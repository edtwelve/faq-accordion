## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project i finally applied 'querySelectorAll' and how to use it to target all elements of one type, whether an element or one that contains a class.

```js
questions.forEach(function(question) {
    question.addEventListener('click', function(){})
})
```

Also the 'classList' to modify an element current state depending of its classes.
